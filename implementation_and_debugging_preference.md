# AI Debug & Build Playbook

### Purpose

A living log and template for hypothesis‑driven debugging, implementation, and testing when collaborating with an AI assistant on your web‑app work.

## How to use this document

1. **Copy the template below** into a fresh section each time you raise a new issue or feature request.
2. Fill in the *Observed symptom* (or *Desired feature*) field.
3. Ask the AI to populate *Hypotheses*, a detailed *Implementation plan*, and an *Automated test script*.
4. Run (or let the AI run) the test; paste outcomes in *Results & notes*.
5. Iterate by updating the same entry or creating a linked follow‑up entry.
6. Avoid commit and push changes to Github until the human test and validated the changes

### [2025-05-08] Issue: Resume Content Alignment Inconsistencies

**Attempt number**
1

**Observed symptom / Desired behaviour**
Resume content shows inconsistent alignment in the HTML/PDF preview:
1. Role descriptions aligned with company names instead of with bullet points
2. Section header boxes not aligned with section content
3. Bullet points for achievements not consistently aligned with other content

**Hypotheses (root-cause or design assumptions)**
1. HTML structure issues: Role descriptions might be placed outside the proper containing element
2. CSS margin/padding inconsistencies: Different margin and padding values applied inconsistently
3. Duplicate CSS rules: Overlapping and conflicting rules in the CSS files
4. Container relationship issues: Parent-child relationships not properly structured for consistent alignment

**Implementation plan**
- [x] Analyze HTML generation in the `format_job_entry` function to check placement of role descriptions
- [x] Check section box styling and its relationship to content alignment in _resume.scss
- [x] Review all margin/padding settings for consistency and use of design tokens
- [x] Look for duplicate or conflicting CSS rules that might affect alignment
- [x] Implement fixes for each issue and test in both HTML/PDF and DOCX formats

**Automated test script**
```bash
# Regenerate tokens after changes
python tools/generate_tokens.py

# Start the development server
python app.py

# Access http://localhost:5000 in browser
# Test the HTML preview, PDF download, and DOCX download 
# Compare alignment across all formats
```

## **Results & notes**

* Issue 1 (Role descriptions): Fixed by moving the role description inside the `job-content` div in the `format_job_entry` function of `html_generator.py`
* Issue 2 (Section header alignment): Fixed by adding `margin-left: $content-left-margin` to the `.section-box` class
* Issue 3 (Bullet point alignment): Fixed by adding consistent left margin to job containers and removing duplicate styling rules

The application now displays proper alignment in both HTML/PDF and DOCX outputs:
- Section headers properly aligned with content
- Role descriptions properly indented with bullet points
- Consistent bullet point indentation

**Lessons & next steps**

* HTML/CSS alignment requires careful attention to container relationships
* Using consistent design tokens for margins and padding helps maintain visual consistency
* Duplicate CSS rules can cause hard-to-diagnose styling issues
* Different output formats (HTML vs DOCX) require different technical approaches but can achieve the same visual result

Next steps:
1. Consider implementing visual regression testing for alignment issues
2. Create a visual style guide for alignment patterns
3. Review any remaining inconsistencies in section spacing
