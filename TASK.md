## Implementation Plan

The resume tailoring application uses a Flask backend with a simple frontend interface. The core functionality revolves around:

1. Resume parsing and section extraction:
   - Uses python-docx to extract content from DOCX files
   - Identifies sections through heading styles and text formatting
   - Implements fallback mechanisms for non-standard formats
   
   **Enhanced LLM-based Resume Parsing:**
   - Integrate LLM (Claude/OpenAI) as the primary method for resume parsing
   - Send the entire resume content to LLM with a prompt to identify and categorize sections
   - Store parsed sections in a structured JSON format with section types as keys
   - Implement a fallback mechanism to use the existing regex/heading-based parser if:
     - LLM API call fails (network/authentication issues)
     - LLM response doesn't contain expected section structure
     - Timeout occurs during LLM processing
   - Cache LLM parsing results to avoid repeated API calls for the same resume
   - Add logging for both successful LLM parsing and fallbacks to traditional parsing
   - Create a configurable toggle to enable/disable LLM parsing for testing/development

2. Job listing parsing:
   - Scrapes job listings from LinkedIn and other URLs
   - Extracts requirements, skills, and job details
   - Formats job data for AI processing
   
   **Enhanced LLM-based Job Analysis:**
   - Integrate LLM (Claude/OpenAI) to intelligently analyze job postings
   - Send the complete job text to LLM with a prompt to extract structured insights
   - Have the LLM identify:
     - Candidate profile: What type of candidates the position is targeting
     - Hard skills: Technical and job-specific skills required
     - Soft skills: Personal and interpersonal skills valued
     - Ideal candidate: Comprehensive description of the perfect match
   - Return the analysis in structured JSON format for frontend consumption
   - Cache the LLM analysis results to avoid repeated API calls
   - Implement fallback to regex-based parsing if LLM analysis fails
   - Add logging for the analysis process and results
   - Add a configurable toggle to enable/disable LLM job analysis

3. AI-powered tailoring:
   - Uses Claude AI through Anthropic API or OpenAI API
   - Analyzes resume sections against job requirements
   - Generates tailored content that emphasizes relevant experience

4. Document generation:
   - Creates new DOCX files with tailored content
   - Preserves original formatting and structure
   - Provides downloadable files and HTML preview

## LLM Resume Parsing Implementation Details
