# Consolidated Archive - Resume Tailor Project

This directory contains all archived, downloaded, and test files from the Resume Tailor project, organized into a clean structure for easy navigation.

## Directory Structure

### 📁 `downloaded_files/`
- All downloaded resume files (PDF and DOCX formats)
- Generated by the web application when users download their tailored resumes
- Files follow naming pattern: `downloaded*.*`

### 📁 `generated_resumes/`
- All generated resume files from testing and development
- Includes:
  - `tailored_resume_*.docx` - Generated by the tailoring system
  - `NanaWangResume_*.docx` - Resume versions
  - Test output files and ZIP backups
  - Manual edits and variations

### 📁 `test_outputs/`
- Test files generated during development
- Diagnostic outputs
- Experimental formatting tests

### 📁 `debug_files/`
- Debug scripts and utilities
- Log files (boxes.log, app_restart.log)
- CSS and styling test files
- Image files and temporary documents
- Word temporary files (~$*.docx)

### 📁 `documentation/`
This consolidates three previous archive folders:

#### `old_archive/` (from `archive/`)
- Technical documentation and guides
- Test files and diagnostic outputs
- Debug logs and analysis files
- Audio recordings and transcripts
- Test scripts and implementation files

#### `md_backup/` (from `archive_md_backup/`)
- Markdown documentation backup
- Implementation guides and plans
- Feature documentation

#### `archived_legacy/` (from `archived/`)
- Legacy test files and templates
- Commit message history
- Early implementation files
- UI design suggestions and screenshots
- Resume templates and test data

## File Organization Notes

- **Latest files preserved**: When duplicate filenames existed across the three archive folders, the most recent version was kept
- **Logical grouping**: Files are organized by type and purpose rather than chronological order
- **Easy navigation**: Clear directory structure makes it easy to find specific types of content

## Purpose

This consolidated archive serves as:
1. A clean backup of all development artifacts
2. Historical record of the project evolution
3. Reference for debugging and troubleshooting
4. Resource for understanding past implementation decisions
