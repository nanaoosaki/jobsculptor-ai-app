# Implementation Plan for Styling Changes

## ISSUE RESOLVED: Styling Changes Now Apply Correctly

The issue where styling changes weren't visible in the preview or PDF has been resolved. The key fix was properly restarting the Flask server after making changes, combined with following the complete styling update workflow.

## Validated Workflow for Resume Styling Changes

Based on successful tests (including changing section header color to pink), follow this process for all styling changes:

| Step | Action | Command / Tool |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Edit tokens or SCSS | Edit `static/scss/_resume.scss` or other SCSS files |
| 2 | Re-generate tokens (if needed) | `python tools/generate_tokens_css.py` |
| 3 | Build CSS | `sass static/scss/preview.scss static/css/preview.css` <br> `sass static/scss/print.scss static/css/print.css` |
| 4 | **Restart Flask dev server** | `Ctrl-C` then `python app.py` |
| 5 | Hard refresh browser | `Ctrl+Shift+R` |
| 6 | Verify preview & PDF | Check both HTML preview and generated PDF |

**IMPORTANT**: Missing any of these steps, especially #4 (restarting Flask), will result in styling changes not being applied.

## Correct Steps for Adjusting Margins

To adjust the margins for both the HTML preview and PDF outputs, follow these steps:

1. **Edit `design_tokens.json`**:
   - Update `pageMarginVertical`, `pageMarginHorizontal`, `paper-padding-vertical`, and `paper-padding-horizontal` to the desired size (e.g., "1cm").

2. **Generate Updated Tokens**:
   - Run `python tools/generate_tokens_css.py` to regenerate the SCSS tokens.

3. **Compile SCSS**:
   - Use `sass` to compile the SCSS files into CSS:
     ```bash
     sass static/scss/preview.scss static/css/preview.css
     sass static/scss/print.scss static/css/print.css
     ```

4. **Restart Flask**:
   - Restart the Flask application to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you ensure that both the HTML preview and PDF outputs reflect the updated margin settings.

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Centralized Token Management**: Ensure all margin settings are updated in `design_tokens.json` for consistency.
2. **Token Regeneration**: Always regenerate tokens after making changes to `design_tokens.json`.
3. **SCSS Compilation**: Compile SCSS files to apply changes to CSS.
4. **Flask Restart**: Restart the Flask server to ensure all changes are applied.

These steps ensure that styling changes are consistently applied across both the preview and PDF outputs, maintaining a unified appearance.

## NEW ISSUE RESOLVED: Bullet Point Overlapping with Text

The issue where bullet points were overlapping with the text in the resume has been resolved. The key fix was to implement proper CSS spacing and positioning for bullet points.

### Root Cause Analysis

The bullet points were properly displayed with the correct symbol, but the CSS styling lacked proper spacing and positioning between the bullet and the text. This was due to:

1. Insufficient padding and indentation in the list items
2. Inconsistent positioning of the bullet points
3. Lack of proper text indentation to align the text correctly with the bullet

### Implementation Details

To fix the issue, the following changes were made:

1. **Added New Design Tokens**:
   - `bullet-list-padding-left`: Controls the left padding of bullet lists
   - `bullet-item-padding-left`: Controls the left padding of list items
   - `bullet-item-text-indent`: Controls the text indentation of list items

2. **Updated SCSS Styling**:
   - Applied a consistent approach to bullet point styling across all list types
   - Used the `::before` pseudo-element for bullet placement with proper positioning
   - Applied proper padding and text-indent to ensure correct text alignment

### Validation

The fix was tested in both the HTML preview and PDF output, confirming that bullet points no longer overlap with text and are properly aligned.

## Correct Steps for Fixing Bullet Point Alignment

To fix bullet point alignment issues, follow these steps:

1. **Edit `design_tokens.json`**:
   - Add or update bullet-point related tokens:
   ```json
   {
     "bullet-list-padding-left": "1.5em",
     "bullet-item-padding-left": "1em",
     "bullet-item-text-indent": "-1em"
   }
   ```

2. **Update SCSS Files**:
   - Ensure list items use consistent styling with proper positioning
   - Use the `::before` pseudo-element with absolute positioning for custom bullets
   - Apply proper padding and indentation

3. **Generate Updated Tokens**:
   - Run `python tools/generate_tokens_css.py` to regenerate the SCSS tokens

4. **Compile SCSS**:
   - Use `sass` to compile the SCSS files into CSS:
   ```bash
   sass static/scss/preview.scss static/css/preview.css
   sass static/scss/print.scss static/css/print.css
   ```

5. **Restart Flask**:
   - Restart the Flask application to apply the changes

6. **Validate Changes**:
   - Check both HTML preview and PDF output to ensure consistent bullet point alignment

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Consistent Bullet Point Approach**: Use the same technique for all bullet points in the resume for consistent appearance.
2. **Proper CSS Positioning**: For custom bullets, use absolute positioning with proper offsets.
3. **Text Indentation Control**: Use both padding and text-indent to align text properly with bullets.
4. **Single Source of Truth**: Keep spacing values in design tokens for consistency and easier maintenance.
5. **Test Both Outputs**: Always verify changes in both HTML preview and PDF output to ensure consistent appearance.

## Implementation History

### Successful Implementation of Pink and Blue Section Headers

We successfully implemented both blue and pink section header boxes, confirming our styling process works. The changes were:

1. Updating the `.section-box` class styling in `_resume.scss`
2. Rebuilding CSS files with sass
3. Restarting the Flask server
4. Verifying the changes appeared correctly in both preview and PDF

This confirms that the styling pipeline is working properly and can be used for future visual enhancements.

### 2025-04-26  – Border Outline Fix

Issue: blue outline visible in PDF but missing in browser preview. 

Root Cause →  `removeNestedScrollbars()` in `static/js/main.js` set `style.border = 'none'` on every injected element, wiping the `.section-box` border. PDF engine does not run JS, so outline survived in PDF.

Fix implemented:
1. Removed the two `style.border = 'none'` statements from `removeNestedScrollbars()`.
2. Added `!important` to the `.section-box` border rule in `_resume.scss` for extra safety.
3. Re-built `preview.css` and `print.css`.
4. Restarted Flask dev server.

Expected → outline now shows in both HTML preview and PDF. This eliminates the last preview-vs-PDF divergence.

### 2025-04-27  – Centralised bullet-cleanup refactor (planned)

We observed that quick patches did not fully eliminate stray `u2022` artefacts. Analysis shows the text bullets are injected at multiple stages (LLM responses, HTML back-parsing, raw resume parsing). To guarantee a single-bullet output we will **centralise bullet stripping** in one utility and pipe **every** textual pathway through it.

**Goals**
1. All Unicode/ASCII/textual/HTML bullet markers removed **before** HTML generation.
2. No duplication of regexes across the codebase—all import the same constant.
3. Regression guard: automated test + runtime validation.

**Implementation outline**
A. `utils/bullet_utils.py` (already created)
   • Holds `BULLET_ESCAPE_RE` and `strip_bullet_prefix()`.

B. Refactor steps
   1. `clean_bullet_points()` → thin wrapper around `strip_bullet_prefix()`.
   2. In **all** formatter functions (`_format_experience_json`, `_format_education_json`, `_format_projects_json`, `_format_skills_json`) call `strip_bullet_prefix()` on each list item (achievements, highlights, details, skills).
   3. In `html_generator.format_section_content()` run `strip_bullet_prefix()` on every line *before* bullet-detection regex.
   4. Inside JSON extractors (`_extract_experience_from_html`, etc.) call helper on each recovered string.
   5. Replace hard-coded patterns in `validate_bullet_point_cleaning()` with `bullet_utils.BULLET_ESCAPE_RE`.

C. Unit test
   • `tests/test_bullet_utils.py` ensures a variety of prefixes (`'• '`, `'u2022'`, `'\u2022'`, `'1. '`, `'2) '`) are stripped correctly.

D. Deployment checklist
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Implement refactor changes & run `pytest` |
| 2 | Rebuild site, restart Flask |
| 3 | Tailor known-problem resume → verify preview & PDF have clean bullets |
| 4 | Commit & push; document success here |

**Fallback plan**  
A feature flag `STRIP_BULLETS=False` (env var or settings) will bypass the new stripping layer in case of unforeseen side-effects.

## Original Implementation Plan (Reference Only)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand original implementation plan</summary>

### Phase 0 – Rapid Proof (½ hr)
- Edit `_resume.scss`, add `body{outline:5px solid red!important;}` rebuild SCSS, refresh preview.
  - If no red outline appears ⇒ CSS not loaded / not rebuilt.
  - If outline appears ⇒ markup mismatch is the culprit.

### Phase 1 – Unify Markup (4 hrs)
- **Option A (recommended)**: Eliminate the Python string-builder, use the existing Jinja template for both preview and PDF.
  1. Create `generate_html_from_template(data, for_screen)` that renders `resume_pdf.html` (rename to `resume.html`).
  2. Replace the big block in `html_generator.generate_preview_from_llm_responses()` with a call to the new helper.
  3. Pass the same HTML body to `PDFExporter`.

- **Option B (quicker)**: Keep Python generator but emit the classes expected by SCSS.
  - Wrap every section header in `<div class="section-box">`
  - Emit `.position-bar`, `.job-content ul.bullets`, etc.

### Phase 2 – Enforce Style Build (2 hrs)
1. Add `npm script` or `make build-css` that runs:
   ```bash
   python tools/generate_tokens_css.py
   sass static/scss/preview.scss static/css/preview.css
   sass static/scss/print.scss   static/css/print.css
   ```
2. Git pre-commit hook + CI job: fail if `git diff --exit-code static/css` is non-empty after running the build script (prevents stale CSS).

### Phase 3 – Remove Legacy Overrides (1 hr)
- Find and delete/reset the blanket `body,*{line-height:1.4}` and similar rules from `preview.css` / `_base.scss`.
- Keep all typography in `_tokens.scss` / `_resume.scss`.

### Phase 4 – Visual Validation (2 hrs)
- **Automated**: Playwright script that:
  1. Loads `/preview?id=test`
  2. Generates PDF, rasterises page 1 with `pdf2image`
  3. Compares preview screenshot vs PDF (SSIM ≥ 0.95)

- **Manual**: Spot-check long bullets, boxed headers, tight leading.

### Phase 5 – Documentation & Clean-up (1 hr)
- Update `single-source styling.md` with the new pipeline diagram (data → Jinja → SCSS → preview/PDF).
- Move the old Python HTML generator to `archived/`.

### Debug Attempt – Hot-Pink Border Test

**Observation**: After rebuilding `preview.css` and `print.css` with a forced hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R`), _no hot-pink dashed borders were visible_ around any section headings in either the browser preview or the generated PDF.

### What this suggested
The element that the rule targets was **not present in the live DOM**.  Therefore we had a **selector ↔ markup mismatch** rather than a stylesheet issue.

### Root Cause Confirmed
After testing hypothesis H-1, we confirmed that **Flask server was still running old code** that didn't emit `.section-box` wrappers. The hot-reloader was not reloading the Python modules that were imported at startup.

</details>

## Deliverable Checklist
- ☑ Unified HTML source (`resume.html`) used everywhere
- ☑ CSS build script + CI guard
- ☑ Markup includes `.section-box`, `.position-bar`, `.tailored-resume-content` with token-driven spacing
- ☑ Legacy override rules removed
- ☑ Playwright visual regression test green
- ☑ `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` updated when issue confirmed fixed

Implementing these steps will make future styling tweaks immediately visible, eliminate dead code paths, and give automated assurance that preview and PDF remain in lock-step.

### Experiment 0 results (26-Apr)  
• Added `body{outline:5px solid red}` – outline showed **only in PDF** → CSS compiled fine, but preview ignored it.  
• After moving `<link rel="preview.css">` to main template and switching generator to fragment-only, preview still unchanged, PDF changed (enlarged).  

**What we proved**  
1. `preview.css` now does load in the browser.  
2. Selectors in `_resume.scss` do **not** match existing markup.  
3. `$paper-width-a4:8.5in` is wider than A4 ⇒ WeasyPrint shrinks => perceived enlargement.

**Root cause hypothesis refined**  
A. HTML emitted by `html_generator` lacks classes `.section-box`, `.position-bar`, `.bullets` therefore resume-scoped rules never fire.  
B. Bootstrap and `styles.css` still inherit into resume fragment, overriding type scale / spacing.  
C. Wrong paper width.

### 26-Apr Fix Plan in progress (Step 1)
1. ✅ Modify `html_generator.py` to emit:  
   • `<div class="section-box"><h2>…</h2></div>` around every section header.  
   • `.position-bar` wrapper for company/position lines.  
   • `<ul class="bullets">` for multi-item content.  
2. ✅ Reset UI inheritance and update paper width:
   • Added style isolation in `_resume.scss` to prevent Bootstrap styles from leaking in.
   • Changed `$paper-width-a4` from 8.5in to 8.27in (standard A4 width).
   • Updated `@page` rule in `print.scss` with proper A4 size and margins.

*Implementation complete*: CSS rebuilt with all changes.

**Remaining to verify**:
1. Preview should now show boxed headers, bold metadata, and properly spaced bullets.
2. PDF should match preview and have correct width (no more enlargement).
3. Run through the full checklist in the original implementation plan.

**Next Steps**:
- If styling still doesn't appear correctly, we'll need to check browser developer tools to see if our new classes are present in the DOM and if any CSS rules are being overridden.
- We might also verify CSS loading by adding a temporary test style (like `.section-box { border: 3px dashed hotpink; }`) to confirm rule application. 

## 2024-06-XX Debug Attempt – Hot-Pink Border Test

**Observation**: After rebuilding `preview.css` and `print.css` with a forced hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R`), _no hot-pink dashed borders were visible_ around any section headings in either the browser preview or the generated PDF.

### What this disproves
1. **Token values missing** – ❌  
   The border rule was hard-coded (not token-based) with `3px dashed hotpink !important`.  If CSS had reached the element, the colour would show even if design-token variables were `null`.
2. **CSS specificity / overrides** – ❌  
   `!important` should have defeated competing rules.
3. **Browser cache** – ❌  
   A hard refresh was performed; plus the compiled `preview.css` on disk shows the dashed rule.

### What this suggests
The element that the rule targets is **not present in the live DOM**.  Therefore we are back to a **selector ↔ markup mismatch** rather than a stylesheet issue.

### New Hypotheses (H-series)
| ID | Hypothesis | Quick test |
|----|------------|-----------|
| H-1 | **Flask server is still running old code** that doesn't emit `.section-box` wrappers (hot-reloader disabled). | Restart Flask server and re-tailor; check markup again. |
| H-2 | There is **another HTML generator** in the runtime path (duplicate module) that was never updated. | Add `console.log(previewHtml.slice(0,300))` in `displayResumePreview` or inspect DevTools → Elements to see actual HTML.  Search for the literal `section-box` string. |
| H-3 | `generate_preview_from_llm_responses` is being **shadow-imported** at startup; our edits are in the file but not in the module instance due to import aliasing. | In Python shell: `import html_generator, inspect; print(inspect.getsource(html_generator.generate_preview_from_llm_responses)[:300])` while server is running. |
| H-4 | The **preview HTML is sanitised** elsewhere (e.g., removed wrapper divs) before being inserted into the DOM. | Put a sentinel string like `<!-- SBOX TEST -->` near the wrapper; see if it survives in output. |
| H-5 | Frontend JS **injects HTML fragments** that overwrite the wrapper, e.g., by stripping outer `<div>`s. | Temporarily comment out `removeNestedScrollbars` and inspect resulting DOM. |

### Immediate Next-Steps Checklist
1. 🔄 Restart Flask server (confirm reload in logs).  
2. 🕵️‍♀️ Open Chrome DevTools > Elements, expand first few nodes inside `.tailored-resume-content`.  Look for `.section-box`.
3. 📝 Document exact HTML snippet for one heading (copy/paste).  
4. ➡️ Branch depending on findings:  
   • If `.section-box` **present** ⇒ CSS somehow not applied (re-investigate cascade).  
   • If `.section-box` **absent** ⇒ pursue H-1/H-2/H-3/H-4/H-5.

> If none of these paths bear fruit, we should seriously consider **abandoning the bespoke Python generator** and moving to a single Jinja template so that markup and styling evolve together.

## 🎉 2024-06-XX Post-Mortem – Why it finally worked

After hours of chasing SCSS and token bugs, the immediate blocker turned out to be embarrassingly simple:

*The Flask development server had been running continuously, so it never imported the modified `html_generator.py`.*  When we finally stopped and restarted the server, it imported the new code that emits `.section-box` wrappers, making our CSS selectors match and the styles show up instantly.

### Lessons Learned
1. **Python code changes require a server restart.**  Flask's reloader only watches templates and static assets by default; deep module imports cached at startup don't reload reliably.
2. **SCSS compilation is a separate step.**  Even if the CSS file is rebuilt, it won't help if the HTML it targets isn't regenerated by the backend.
3. **Proof-of-life CSS still invaluable.**  The hot-pink border test confirmed CSS loaded correctly; lack of border pointed to markup mismatch rather than styling.

### Correct Workflow for Styling Changes
| Step | Action | Command / Tool |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Edit tokens or SCSS | `vim static/scss/*.scss` |
| 2 | Re-generate tokens | `python tools/generate_tokens_css.py` |
| 3 | Build CSS | `sass static/scss/preview.scss static/css/preview.css && sass static/scss/print.scss static/css/print.css` (or `npm run build-css`) |
| 4 | **Restart Flask dev server** | `Ctrl-C` then `python app.py` |
| 5 | Hard refresh browser (Ctrl-Shift-R) | — |
| 6 | Verify preview & PDF | UI |

Missing any one of these (especially #4) can give misleading results.

## Successful Implementation of Blue Boxes

### Overview
The recent changes successfully implemented blue section header boxes with a filled background, aligning with the desired resume format.

### Key Changes
1. **Section Header Box**: Updated the `.section-box` class to have a blue fill and white text, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent look across both HTML preview and PDF outputs.
2. **CSS Rebuild**: Rebuilt both `preview.css` and `print.css` to apply the new styles effectively.
3. **Testing and Verification**: Verified the changes in both the browser preview and PDF download to ensure consistency and correctness.

### Lessons Learned
- **Consistent Styling**: Ensuring that both the preview and PDF outputs use the same styling rules is crucial for maintaining a unified appearance.
- **Rebuilding CSS**: Always rebuild CSS files after making changes to SCSS to ensure that updates are reflected in the application.
- **Server Restart**: Restarting the Flask server is necessary to apply changes to Python files and ensure that the latest code is running.

### Next Steps
- Continue monitoring for any discrepancies between preview and PDF outputs.
- Document the process for future styling changes to ensure consistency and efficiency.

### Successful Process for Styling Changes

The following process was successfully used to change the section header color to pink:

1. **Edit SCSS Files**: Updated the `_resume.scss` file to change the section header background color to pink.
2. **Re-generate Tokens**: (If needed) Run `generate_tokens_css.py` to update design tokens.
3. **Build CSS**: Compiled the SCSS files into CSS using the `sass` command:
   - `sass static/scss/preview.scss static/css/preview.css`
   - `sass static/scss/print.scss static/css/print.css`
4. **Restart Flask Server**: Restarted the Flask server to apply changes to Python files:
   - `Ctrl-C` then `python app.py`
5. **Verify Changes**: Performed a hard refresh in the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R) and checked both the HTML preview and PDF output to ensure changes were applied correctly.

This process ensures that styling changes are consistently applied across both the preview and PDF outputs. Following these steps will help maintain a unified appearance and streamline future styling updates.

## 2025-04-27  – Bullet-cleanup Attempt #1 Post-Mortem

We centralised bullet stripping in `utils/bullet_utils.py` and wired the new
`strip_bullet_prefix()` helper through all formatter paths. While this removed
many stray glyphs, **textual escapes `u2022` are still leaking into the final
HTML/PDF**. Our latest run (see log excerpt below) shows the cleaned HTML still
contains literal `u2022` at the start of some achievements.

```
… <li>u2022 Led cross-functional AI initiative that …</li>
```

### Findings
1. **Whitespace-prefixed escapes**   If the LLM returns `"  u2022 Achievement"`
   (note the two spaces) our regex fails because it is anchored to column 0.
2. **Down-stream re-injection**   Some content is concatenated _after_ we strip
   bullets (e.g. during `format_section_content` when building `<li>` tags), so
   any bullet prefix that survives earlier stages becomes visible next to the
   rendered list marker.
3. **Validation gap**   `validate_bullet_point_cleaning()` only runs on raw
   _section text_, not on the final HTML fragment. It therefore misses any
   bullets that survive formatting.

### Impact on Logic / Flow
The current cleaning pipeline is **still too early in the data-flow**. We need
an **end-of-pipeline gate** that scans the fully rendered HTML _before_ it is
sent to the client or converted to PDF.

---

## Bullet-cleanup Attempt #2 – Detailed Implementation Plan

| # | Task | Owner | Notes |
|---|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Expand `BULLET_ESCAPE_RE` to allow leading whitespace (`^\s*`) and fix a bug where the trailing `\s*` was stripped _after_ we already called `.lstrip()` | BE | Single-line change in `utils/bullet_utils.py` |
| 2 | Add **HTML-level sanitiser** `html_generator.scrub_bullets_from_html()` that runs the regex across the _entire_ HTML fragment/doc right before it is returned. | BE | Guarantees no bullets make it past this point |
| 3 | Call the sanitiser from `generate_preview_from_llm_responses()` and from `pdf_exporter` before PDF conversion. | BE | Two call-sites |
| 4 | Strengthen `validate_bullet_point_cleaning()` to optionally accept HTML and scan **after formatting**. | BE | Keeps runtime logging useful |
| 5 | Unit tests: | QA | 1) raw line with `"  u2022 Foo"` 2) HTML `<li>u2022 Bar</li>` – both must emerge bullet-free |
| 6 | Regression script: tailor a known problematic resume and assert that `u2022` does **not** appear in the resulting PDF text layer (`pdftotext`). | QA | CI step |
| 7 | Documentation update (this file) once confirmed fixed. | Tech W |  |

### Roll-back Plan
Set env var `RESUMEGEN_SKIP_HTML_BULLET_SCRUB=1` to bypass the new sanitizer if
it causes accidental data loss.

### ETA & Risk
Small patch (<50 LOC) but touches core HTML path – low risk, <1 hr coding, 30 m
validation.

1. **Proper String Escaping**: Ensure all special characters are properly escaped in `design_tokens.json`.
2. **Token Regeneration**: Always regenerate tokens after making changes to `design_tokens.json`.
3. **SCSS Compilation**: Compile SCSS files to apply changes to CSS.
4. **Flask Restart**: Restart the Flask server to ensure all changes are applied.

These steps ensure that styling changes are consistently applied across both the preview and PDF outputs, maintaining a unified appearance.

## NEW ISSUE: Bullet Point Overlapping with Text

A new issue has been identified where bullet points are overlapping with the text in the resume, as shown in the provided image. This issue arose after the previous changes to correct the bullet point display.

### Description
- The bullet points are correctly processed and compiled in the CSS file, but they are not aligning properly with the text, causing an overlap.

### Impact
- The visual appearance of the resume is affected, making it look unprofessional.

### Next Steps
1. Investigate the CSS rules related to bullet point alignment and spacing.
2. Adjust the CSS to ensure proper alignment and spacing of bullet points relative to the text.
3. Verify the changes in both the HTML preview and PDF output to ensure the issue is resolved.

### Priority
- Medium

This issue needs to be addressed to maintain the professional appearance of the resume and ensure that the text is readable and well-aligned.

## NEW ISSUE RESOLVED: Bullet Point Overlapping with Text

The issue where bullet points were overlapping with the text in the resume has been resolved. The key fix was to implement proper CSS spacing and positioning for bullet points.

### Root Cause Analysis

The bullet points were properly displayed with the correct symbol, but the CSS styling lacked proper spacing and positioning between the bullet and the text. This was due to:

1. Insufficient padding and indentation in the list items
2. Inconsistent positioning of the bullet points
3. Lack of proper text indentation to align the text correctly with the bullet

### Implementation Details

To fix the issue, the following changes were made:

1. **Added New Design Tokens**:
   - `bullet-list-padding-left`: Controls the left padding of bullet lists
   - `bullet-item-padding-left`: Controls the left padding of list items
   - `bullet-item-text-indent`: Controls the text indentation of list items

2. **Updated SCSS Styling**:
   - Applied a consistent approach to bullet point styling across all list types
   - Used the `::before` pseudo-element for bullet placement with proper positioning
   - Applied proper padding and text-indent to ensure correct text alignment

### Validation

The fix was tested in both the HTML preview and PDF output, confirming that bullet points no longer overlap with text and are properly aligned.

## Correct Steps for Fixing Bullet Point Alignment

To fix bullet point alignment issues, follow these steps:

1. **Edit `design_tokens.json`**:
   - Add or update bullet-point related tokens:
   ```json
   {
     "bullet-list-padding-left": "1.5em",
     "bullet-item-padding-left": "1em",
     "bullet-item-text-indent": "-1em"
   }
   ```

2. **Update SCSS Files**:
   - Ensure list items use consistent styling with proper positioning
   - Use the `::before` pseudo-element with absolute positioning for custom bullets
   - Apply proper padding and indentation

3. **Generate Updated Tokens**:
   - Run `python tools/generate_tokens_css.py` to regenerate the SCSS tokens

4. **Compile SCSS**:
   - Use `sass` to compile the SCSS files into CSS:
   ```bash
   sass static/scss/preview.scss static/css/preview.css
   sass static/scss/print.scss static/css/print.css
   ```

5. **Restart Flask**:
   - Restart the Flask application to apply the changes

6. **Validate Changes**:
   - Check both HTML preview and PDF output to ensure consistent bullet point alignment

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Consistent Bullet Point Approach**: Use the same technique for all bullet points in the resume for consistent appearance.
2. **Proper CSS Positioning**: For custom bullets, use absolute positioning with proper offsets.
3. **Text Indentation Control**: Use both padding and text-indent to align text properly with bullets.
4. **Single Source of Truth**: Keep spacing values in design tokens for consistency and easier maintenance.
5. **Test Both Outputs**: Always verify changes in both HTML preview and PDF output to ensure consistent appearance.

## ISSUE: Adjusting Section Header Box Height

**Goal**: Reduce the vertical height of the section header boxes (e.g., "PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY") to be a tighter fit around the text content, similar to Image 2 provided earlier.

**Status**: Unresolved (after multiple failed attempts).

### Attempt 1 (Width Fix with `fit-content` - Failed)
*   **Changes**: Introduced `sectionBoxWidth: fit-content`, `sectionBoxDisplay: inline-block` tokens and updated SCSS.
*   **Result**: Failed, created unexpected brackets/boxes in HTML preview and PDF.
*   **Reason**: Likely `fit-content` incompatibility with WeasyPrint and conflicts arising from changing `display` type without addressing HTML structure differences (`div > h2` vs `div > text`).

### Attempt 2 (Width Fix with `inline-block` - Partially Successful, Height Unchanged)
*   **Changes**: Used `display: inline-block`, `max-width: var(--sectionBoxMaxWidth, auto)`. Updated padding/line-height/font-size tokens.
*   **Result**: Successfully fixed width to fit content, but **height remained unchanged**. Also caused WeasyPrint warnings for `max-width: auto`.
*   **Reason**: Width constraint worked. Height issue persisted, indicating padding/line-height changes weren't targeting the correct element or were overridden. CSS variables and WeasyPrint incompatibility were likely factors.

### Attempt 3 (Height Focus with CSS Variables - Failed)
*   **Changes**: Reduced vertical padding token (`2px`), added line-height (`1.1`) and font-size (`12pt`) tokens. Applied these using `var()` to `.section-box` and `.resume-section h2`. Changed `max-width` fallback to `none`.
*   **Result**: Height still unchanged.
*   **Reason**: Applying styles with `var()` to both `.section-box` and the nested `h2` likely caused conflicts or specificity issues. The underlying HTML structure difference wasn't addressed. WeasyPrint's potential lack of support for these CSS variables could also explain the failure in the PDF.

### Root Cause Analysis Summary
*   **HTML Structure Discrepancy**: The primary issue is the difference between the preview (`div > h2`) and PDF (`div > text`) structures. The `h2` tag in the preview introduces default styles (margins, line-height) that interfere with height control.
*   **CSS Variable Incompatibility**: WeasyPrint has limited support for CSS custom properties (`var(...)`), making them unreliable for consistent styling between preview and PDF.
*   **Targeting Issues**: Previous attempts didn't correctly target or override the element controlling the final rendered height, especially due to the nested `h2`.

### Plan for Attempt 4 (Unify HTML & Use SCSS Vars)
1.  **Unify HTML**: Modify `html_generator.py` to remove the `<h2>` tags inside `.section-box`, making preview match PDF.
2.  **Refine Tokens**: Use specific SCSS tokens for padding, line-height, font-size, and max-width.
3.  **Update SCSS**: Apply styles directly to `.section-box` using SCSS variables only. Remove separate `h2` rules.
4.  **Standard Workflow**: Regenerate tokens, compile CSS, restart server.
5.  **Test**: Verify height reduction in both preview and PDF.

This approach aims for consistency by fixing the HTML structure and avoiding potential WeasyPrint issues with CSS variables.

## Successful Implementation: Attempt 4 – Adjusting Section Header Height

### Overview
The fourth attempt to adjust the section header height was successful. The changes ensured that the section headers fit tightly around the text content, as shown in the provided image.

### Key Changes
1. **Unified HTML Structure**: Modified `html_generator.py` to remove `<h2>` tags inside `.section-box`, ensuring the preview matches the PDF structure.
2. **Refined SCSS Tokens**: Used specific SCSS tokens for padding, line-height, font-size, and max-width.
3. **Updated SCSS**: Applied styles directly to `.section-box` using SCSS variables, removing separate `h2` rules.
4. **Standard Workflow**: Followed the validated workflow for styling changes, including regenerating tokens, compiling CSS, and restarting the server.
5. **Testing**: Verified the height reduction in both HTML preview and PDF output.

### Lessons Learned
- **HTML Structure Consistency**: Ensuring the HTML structure is consistent between preview and PDF is crucial for reliable styling.
- **Avoiding CSS Variable Issues**: WeasyPrint's limited support for CSS variables necessitates careful consideration of their use.
- **Targeting the Correct Elements**: Directly targeting the `.section-box` for styling changes was key to success.

### Why Previous Attempts Failed
- **Attempt 1**: Incompatibility with `fit-content` and HTML structure differences led to visual artifacts.
- **Attempt 2**: Width adjustments were successful, but height remained unchanged due to incorrect targeting.
- **Attempt 3**: CSS variable incompatibility and targeting issues prevented effective height adjustment.

### Architectural Implications
- **Unified Markup**: Moving towards a unified HTML structure for both preview and PDF will simplify future styling changes.
- **SCSS Token Usage**: Consistent use of SCSS tokens ensures maintainability and consistency across outputs.

### Future Recommendations
- **Consistent Testing**: Always verify changes in both HTML preview and PDF outputs.
- **Regular Workflow**: Follow the validated workflow for styling changes to ensure all steps are completed.
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of changes and lessons learned to streamline future updates.
