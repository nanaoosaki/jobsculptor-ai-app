# Resume Section Parsing Improvements

## Problem Identified

The resume parsing system was failing to extract essential sections (summary, experience, education, skills) from uploaded resumes, especially those with non-standard formatting. This was causing the Claude AI tailoring process to fail because it didn't have the necessary content to work with.

## Improvements Made

### Enhanced Section Detection

1. **Expanded Regex Patterns**
   - Added more keywords for each section type:
     - Contact: added "address"
     - Summary: added "about"
     - Experience: added "career", "professional"
     - Education: added "school", "academic"
     - Skills: added "qualification", "proficiencies"

2. **Better Default Section Handling**
   - Changed initial section from "header" to "contact" for better categorization of initial content

3. **Diagnostic Logging**
   - Added detailed logging of potential section headers
   - Logged formatting and style information to assist with debugging
   - Added paragraph counting to validate document parsing

### Fallback Mechanism

Implemented a robust fallback approach for cases where standard section detection fails:
- If no sections are detected beyond contact, process the entire document as experience section
- Return a structured response even in case of parsing errors
- Ensures downstream processes have required data structure even if parsing is imperfect

### Error Handling

- Added comprehensive error handling throughout the resume section extraction process
- Log detailed extraction results including character counts for each section
- Return a structured error message in case of exceptions instead of empty responses

## Results

The improved resume parser can now successfully extract content from a wide variety of resume formats, including those without standard section headers or with unique formatting. This ensures that the Claude AI tailoring process has the necessary content to work with, resulting in properly tailored resumes for job applications.

The logs now clearly show which sections were detected and how much content was extracted, making debugging much easier in case of issues.
