# Resume Tailoring Website Using LLM Technology

A web application that helps job seekers optimize their resumes for specific job postings using AI technology.

## Features

- Upload and parse resumes (DOCX and PDF formats)
- Extract key requirements from job listings (supports LinkedIn and generic job sites)
- Automatically tailor resume content to match job requirements
- Preview tailored resumes in HTML format
- Download professionally formatted DOCX files with native bullet points

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API (with support for multiple LLM providers)
- **Document Processing**: python-docx for DOCX generation, docx2txt for parsing
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup, Requests
- **Styling**: SCSS compilation with design token system

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd manusResume6
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=your_flask_secret_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   # Optional: CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
   # Optional: DOCX_USE_NATIVE_BULLETS=true
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

5. Access the application at http://localhost:5000

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main Flask application
- `config.py`: Configuration settings
- `claude_integration.py`: LLM API integration for resume tailoring (supports OpenAI and Claude)
- `job_parser.py`: Job listing parsing functionality
- `resume_formatter.py`: Resume formatting utilities
- `resume_processor.py`: Resume processing and analysis
- `utils/docx_builder.py`: Professional DOCX document generation with native bullet support
- `word_styles/`: Advanced DOCX styling system with native Word numbering
- `static/`: CSS, JavaScript, and uploads
  - `uploads/`: Location for uploaded resumes, job data, and tailored outputs.
  - `uploads/api_responses/`: Stores raw, timestamped LLM API responses for debugging.
  - `uploads/temp_session_data/`: Stores cleaned, tailored resume sections per user request (UUID-based filenames). **Requires cleanup.**
- `templates/`: HTML templates

## How It Works

1. Upload your resume (DOCX or PDF format)
2. Enter a job listing URL or paste job description
3. The application parses the job listing to extract requirements and skills
4. AI (OpenAI) tailors your resume to highlight relevant experience and skills
5. Preview your tailored resume in HTML format
6. Download your professionally formatted DOCX file

## ðŸ”’ Security & Privacy

This application handles sensitive personal information. **CRITICAL SECURITY MEASURES**:

### Before Making Repository Public
```bash
# Clean all user data (REQUIRED before public commits)
python scripts/cleanup_user_data.py --backup
```

### User Data Protection
- All uploaded resumes and personal data are automatically excluded from git
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` prevents accidental commits of sensitive files
- UUID-based session management for user privacy
- No permanent storage of personal information

### Deployment Security
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Enable HTTPS in production
- User data is automatically cleaned during deployment

## Important Note: Temporary File Cleanup

The application currently stores temporary tailored resume data in `static/uploads/temp_session_data/` using unique request IDs. These files are necessary during the tailoring process but are not automatically cleaned up afterwards. **A cleanup mechanism (e.g., a scheduled task to delete files older than 24 hours) should be implemented** to prevent disk space issues in a production environment. 

For automated cleanup, use the provided script:
```bash
python scripts/cleanup_user_data.py --backup
```
