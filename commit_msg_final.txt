[Cursor] Implement LLM-based resume parsing with fallback mechanism

Key improvements:
- Created new llm_resume_parser.py module with support for Claude and OpenAI
- Integrated LLM parsing into both initial upload and tailoring processes
- Modified upload_handler.py to use LLM parsing during initial resume upload
- Added configuration settings in config.py for enabling/disabling LLM parsing
- Implemented provider selection with auto-detection of available API keys
- Added robust JSON validation, error handling, and logging
- Created caching system to avoid repeated API calls for the same resume
- Added fallback to traditional parsing if LLM parsing fails
- Enhanced application documentation and task tracking

All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing code and preserve
the same interfaces to avoid breaking dependencies.
