# Development Progress Report - April 15, 2025

## Resume Tailoring Application Status

The Resume Tailoring application is now working successfully! The application can:

1. Accept resume uploads in DOCX format
2. Parse job listings from URLs including LinkedIn
3. Extract job requirements and skills
4. Tailor resumes to match job requirements using Claude AI
5. Generate downloadable tailored resumes in DOCX format

## Recent Fixes

### Resume Section Parsing - FIXED

We identified and resolved a critical issue with resume section parsing:

- The parser was failing to extract essential sections (summary, experience, education, skills)
- This was preventing the Claude AI from properly tailoring the resume
- Fixed by enhancing the section detection logic with improved regex patterns
- Added a fallback mechanism that treats the document as experience content when standard detection fails
- Added comprehensive logging to assist with debugging

### JavaScript Display Issues - FIXED

We also fixed the frontend JavaScript code to correctly display the tailored resume preview:

- Separated user resume preview and tailored resume preview handling
- Added clear headings to distinguish between the original and tailored content
- Improved the UI layout to better display both previews

## Testing Results

The application successfully processes resumes and job listings. In recent tests:

- Successfully parsed a Verizon job position with AI requirements
- Correctly extracted resume sections from various resume formats
- Claude AI generated tailored content emphasizing relevant experience and skills
- Generated a properly formatted tailored resume document

## Next Steps

1. Create a resume format validator to help users prepare optimal resumes
2. Add a visual diff feature to highlight tailoring changes
3. Enhance the UI to better display tailored sections
4. Implement alternative LLM providers as fallback options

## GitHub Repository

Note: We've encountered GitHub push protection issues due to API keys in the commit history. The code changes have been committed locally while we work to resolve the GitHub security scanning issues.
