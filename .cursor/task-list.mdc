# Task List Management

Guidelines for creating and managing task lists in markdown files to track project progress

## Task List Creation

1. Create task lists in a markdown file (in the project root):
   - Use "TASK.md" or a descriptive name relevant to the feature (e.g., `FEATURE_NAME.md`)
   - Include a clear title and description of the feature being implemented

2. Structure the file with these sections:
   ```markdown
   # Feature Name Implementation

   Brief description of the feature and its purpose.

   ## Completed Tasks

   - [x] Task 1 that has been completed
   - [x] Task 2 that has been completed

   ## In Progress Tasks

   - [ ] Task 3 currently being worked on
   - [ ] Task 4 to be completed soon

   ## Future Tasks

   - [ ] Task 5 planned for future implementation
   - [ ] Task 6 planned for future implementation

   ## Implementation Plan

   Detailed description of how the feature will be implemented.
   ```

## Reference Plan

- [Refactoring Plan: Session-Based Data Storage](mdc:../new-refactor-data-flow.md)

## Task Management Guidelines

1. Use checkboxes to indicate task status:
   - `[x]` for completed tasks
   - `[ ]` for incomplete tasks
   - `[~]` for tasks in progress (optional)

2. Update task status regularly:
   - Move completed tasks to the "Completed Tasks" section
   - Add new tasks to the appropriate section
   - Update the implementation plan as needed

3. Categorize tasks appropriately:
   - Completed: Tasks that have been fully implemented and tested
   - In Progress: Tasks currently being worked on
   - Future: Tasks planned for upcoming development

4. Include implementation details:
   - Provide a clear description for each task
   - Link to relevant documentation or issues where appropriate
   - Add notes about dependencies or requirements 

## Project Task Updates
- [x] Documented styling architecture refactor outcomes in documentation files (`single-source styling.md`, `TASK.md`, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `project_context.md`).
