# Steps for Successful Git Commit and Push

To ensure a successful commit and push to the remote repository, follow these steps:

1. **Stage Changes:**
   - Use `git add .` to stage all changes in the current directory.
   - This prepares the changes to be committed.

2. **Commit Changes:**
   - Use `git commit -m "Your commit message here"` to commit the staged changes.
   - Ensure the commit message is descriptive of the changes made.

3. **Push Changes:**
   - Use `git push origin your-branch-name` to push the committed changes to the remote repository.
   - Replace `your-branch-name` with the actual branch name you are working on.

4. **Verify Push:**
   - Use `git log -1` to check the latest commit and ensure it matches your recent changes.
   - Confirm that the remote repository reflects the latest commit.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your changes are successfully committed and pushed to the remote repository.
