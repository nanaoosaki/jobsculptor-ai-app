# Resume Tailoring Website Using LLM Technology

## Project Overview
This application helps users tailor their resumes to match specific job listings using Claude AI. The application analyzes job postings, extracts requirements, and optimizes the resume accordingly.

## Files and Structure
- **app.py**: Main Flask application entrypoint
- **config.py**: Configuration settings (API keys, upload paths)
- **upload_handler.py**: Handles resume file uploads
- **resume_processor.py**: Processes and analyzes uploaded resumes
- **resume_formatter.py**: Formats resumes into a standardized structure
- **job_parser.py**: Parses job listings from URLs (LinkedIn and generic)
- **claude_integration.py**: Interfaces with Claude AI for resume tailoring
- **tailoring_handler.py**: Orchestrates the tailoring process
- **format_handler.py**: API routes for resume formatting
- **job_parser_handler.py**: API routes for job parsing
- **static/css/styles.css**: Styling for the application
- **static/js/main.js**: Frontend JavaScript
- **templates/index.html**: Main HTML interface
- **static/uploads/**: Stores uploaded and processed files

## Input/Output Flow
1. **Input**: User uploads DOCX resume and provides job listing URL
2. **Processing**: 
   - Resume is formatted into standardized structure
   - Job listing is parsed to extract requirements and skills
   - Claude AI tailors resume content to match job requirements
3. **Output**: Tailored resume available for download as DOCX

## Fixes Applied
1. Added proper secret key for Flask app security
2. Created correct folder structure for Flask app (templates/, static/)
3. Fixed template_resume.docx path issue by copying to static/uploads directory
4. Fixed 'summary' KeyError by properly initializing empty sections
5. Enhanced section handling to properly check for empty content before processing
6. Fixed regex character range error in job_parser.py that was causing LinkedIn job parsing to fail
7. Fixed demo mode vs. API mode by ensuring the Claude API key is properly configured
8. Added .env and sensitive files to .gitignore to prevent exposing API keys
9. Improved UI layout by aligning "User Resume Parsed" and "Job Requirements" panels side by side
10. Made HTTP/HTTPS dynamic based on certificate availability
11. Ensured proper dependency installation for PDF and DOCX processing

## UI Improvements
- Reorganized the layout to show the "User Resume Parsed" and "Job Requirements" panels side by side in a dedicated row
- Enhanced card styling for consistent heights and better visual alignment
- Ensured responsive design for mobile devices
- Added proper scrolling behavior for content overflow
- Maintained the original step-based workflow with clear visual separation

## Latest Status
- Application is successfully parsing LinkedIn job listings
