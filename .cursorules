# Resume Tailoring Website Using LLM Technology

## Project Overview
This application helps users tailor their resumes to match specific job listings using Claude AI. The application analyzes job postings, extracts requirements, and optimizes the resume accordingly.

## Files and Structure
- **app.py**: Main Flask application entrypoint
- **config.py**: Configuration settings (API keys, upload paths)
- **upload_handler.py**: Handles resume file uploads
- **resume_processor.py**: Processes and analyzes uploaded resumes
- **resume_formatter.py**: Formats resumes into a standardized structure
- **job_parser.py**: Parses job listings from URLs (LinkedIn and generic)
- **claude_integration.py**: Interfaces with Claude AI for resume tailoring
- **tailoring_handler.py**: Orchestrates the tailoring process
- **format_handler.py**: API routes for resume formatting
- **job_parser_handler.py**: API routes for job parsing
- **static/css/styles.css**: Styling for the application
- **static/js/main.js**: Frontend JavaScript
- **templates/index.html**: Main HTML interface
- **static/uploads/**: Stores uploaded and processed files

## Input/Output Flow
1. **Input**: User uploads DOCX resume and provides job listing URL
2. **Processing**: 
   - Resume is formatted into standardized structure
   - Job listing is parsed to extract requirements and skills
   - Claude AI tailors resume content to match job requirements
3. **Output**: Tailored resume available for download as DOCX

## Fixes Applied
1. Added proper secret key for Flask app security
2. Created correct folder structure for Flask app (templates/, static/)
3. Fixed template_resume.docx path issue by copying to static/uploads directory
4. Fixed 'summary' KeyError by properly initializing empty sections
5. Enhanced section handling to properly check for empty content before processing
6. Fixed regex character range error in job_parser.py that was causing LinkedIn job parsing to fail
7. Fixed demo mode vs. API mode by ensuring the Claude API key is properly configured
8. Added .env and sensitive files to .gitignore to prevent exposing API keys
9. Improved UI layout by aligning "User Resume Parsed" and "Job Requirements" panels side by side
10. Made HTTP/HTTPS dynamic based on certificate availability
11. Ensured proper dependency installation for PDF and DOCX processing
12. Significantly improved job parsing to capture "About the job" and all relevant sections
13. Enhanced section detection in job listings using advanced pattern matching
14. Fixed Claude API integration to properly use official Anthropic SDK
15. Removed demo mode fallback to ensure consistent API usage and testing

## Job Parser Improvements
- Added comprehensive section extraction for LinkedIn and generic job postings
- Created intelligent section detection system to capture all major sections ("About the job", "Requirements", etc.)
- Improved bullet point extraction with support for various formats and symbols
- Enhanced skills detection with expanded vocabulary including modern AI/ML skills
- Structured response to include full sections alongside extracted requirements
- Added special handling for "About the job" section to ensure it's always captured

## Claude API Integration Fixes
- Switched from direct HTTP requests to official Anthropic Python SDK
- Added robust error handling and logging of API calls
- Improved environment variable handling to prevent API key issues
- Created more effective prompting for bold, significant changes in tailored content
- Fixed serialization issues when handling Claude API responses

## UI Improvements
- Reorganized the layout to show the "User Resume Parsed" and "Job Requirements" panels side by side in a dedicated row
- Enhanced card styling for consistent heights and better visual alignment
- Ensured responsive design for mobile devices
- Added proper scrolling behavior for content overflow
- Maintained the original step-based workflow with clear visual separation

## Latest Status
- Application is successfully parsing LinkedIn job listings with comprehensive section extraction
- Claude API integration is properly configured and working for resume tailoring
- Job parser now captures the complete job description including "About the job" sections
- Resume preview shows the Claude AI tailored content with significant improvements
- All known blocking issues have been resolved and the application is functioning as expected
